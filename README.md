# Z-Buffer_and_Raytracing

This code was created for the 4th project of PUC-Rio's INF2608 (Fundamentals of Computer Graphics).

The project's objectives were to implement a Raytracing and compare it to OpenGL's Z-Buffer algorithm.
First we create Z-Buffer's rendering and then we start drawing pixel by pixel from the Raytracing's point of view.

The Z-Buffer code does not use the Stencil Buffer, therefore the Raytracing scene has shadows while Z-Buffer's doesn't.

The main code is contained in Raytracing.cpp.
